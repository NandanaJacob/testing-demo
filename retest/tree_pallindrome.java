 * You are given a tree with n nodes rooted at node 1. 
 * You are also given two arrays a and par, where each 
 * node i contains a value represented by a[i], and the 
 * parent of node I is represented by par[i].

A tree is considered palindromic if we can form a palindromic 
sequence using all the values assigned to its nodes. It is given 
that a palindromic sequence reads the same forwards and backward, 
and it must include each value of the nodes in the tree, 
no value can be left unused.

Let ans be a variable equal to o initially. 
For each node u such that its subtree is palindromic, we add i to ans.

Find the value of ans. Since the answer can be large return it modulo 109 + 7.
